# Lambda Transcript Processor v1.2

The Lambda Transcript Processor is a sophisticated AWS serverless application designed to seamlessly integrate YouTube video transcripts with the powerful language understanding capabilities of OpenAI's GPT models. This project allows users to start interactive sessions where they can query the transcript content in natural language, receiving contextually relevant responses.

## Features

- **Transcript Initialization**: Start sessions by providing a video transcript to serve as the context for future interactions.
- **Interactive Q&A**: Pose questions about the transcript and receive accurate, context-aware answers generated by GPT-3.5-turbo-1106.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Built on AWS Lambda for on-demand, scalable processing power.
- **Secure API Key Handling**: Uses AWS environment variables to securely manage API keys.
- **DynamoDB Integration**: Leverages Amazon DynamoDB for efficient storage and retrieval of session states.
